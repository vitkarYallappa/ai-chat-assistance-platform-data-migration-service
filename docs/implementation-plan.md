# Data Migration Service - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the development of a dedicated Data Migration Service for the MCP Service architecture. The service will efficiently handle migrations across sharded MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases while maintaining system integrity and performance.

## Objectives

- Create a standalone service for coordinating complex database migrations
- Support sharded database topologies for both MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Minimize downtime and performance impact during migrations
- Provide monitoring and rollback capabilities
- Integrate with existing MCP, Chat, and Adaptor services

## Database Structure

### MongoDB Collections

MongoDB is used primarily for message-related data and high-volume, document-oriented storage:

| Collection Name | Purpose | Key Fields |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| `messages` | Stores all messages across channels | message_id, conversation_id, tenant_id, channel_id, content, metadata, direction, status, created_at |
| `conversations` | Tracks conversation context and history | conversation_id, tenant_id, user_id, channel_id, status, last_message_at |
| `deliveries` | Message delivery tracking | delivery_id, message_id, tenant_id, status, attempts, last_attempt_at |
| `delivery_attempts` | Individual delivery attempt records | attempt_id, delivery_id, status, error_details, attempt_time |
| `receipts` | Message receipt tracking (read/delivered) | receipt_id, message_id, type, status, timestamp |
| `media_files` | References to media content (images, audio, etc.) | file_id, message_id, tenant_id, type, url, size, metadata |

### PostgreSQL Tables

PostgreSQL is used for structured configuration data and relationship-heavy data:

| Table Name | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------------|---------|------------|
| `tenants` | Core tenant information | id, name, status, created_at, updated_at |
| `tenant_settings` | Tenant-specific settings | tenant_id, settings_key, settings_value |
| `tenant_limits` | Usage limits for tenants | tenant_id, message_limit, channel_limit, storage_limit |
| `tenant_feature_flags` | Feature flags by tenant | tenant_id, feature_key, enabled, configuration |
| `channels` | Channel definitions | id, tenant_id, channel_type, status |
| `channel_configurations` | Channel-specific configurations | channel_id, config_key, config_value |
| `channel_credentials` | Secure channel authentication data | channel_id, credential_type, encrypted_value |
| `webhooks` | Webhook definitions | id, tenant_id, name, url, secret, active |
| `webhook_events` | Events triggering webhooks | webhook_id, event_type, active |
| `webhook_deliveries` | Webhook delivery tracking | id, webhook_id, event_id, status, attempts, last_attempt_at |
| `message_templates` | Pre-defined message templates | id, tenant_id, name, content, variables, channel_type |
| `api_keys` | API authentication keys | id, tenant_id, key_hash, name, permissions, created_at, expires_at |
| `users` | User information for authentication | id, tenant_id, username, email, password_hash, role |
| `roles` | Role definitions for RBAC | id, tenant_id, name, description |
| `permissions` | Permission definitions | id, name, description |
| `role_permissions` | Mapping of roles to permissions | role_id, permission_id |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Database performance degradation during migration | High | Medium | Implement throttling, execute during off-peak hours, batch processing |
| Data inconsistency across shards | High | Medium | Comprehensive validation, rollback capabilities, transactional approaches where possible |
| Service integration issues | Medium | Medium | Early integration testing, mock services, feature flags |
| Scalability limitations | Medium | Low | Performance testing with production-like data volumes, horizontal scaling design |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security review, principle of least privilege, encryption of sensitive data |

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully migrate data across sharded databases with zero data loss
2. Maintain system availability during migrations (less than 5% performance degradation)
3. Support migration rollback with 100% accuracy
4. Provide real-time visibility into migration status
5. Complete full migration scenarios in testing environment with >99% success rate
